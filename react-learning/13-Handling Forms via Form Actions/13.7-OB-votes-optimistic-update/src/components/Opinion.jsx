/**
 *  This is a good example where Optimistic updating might be a good idea
 *      - i.e., becoz when we press the button, we've to wait for 1 sec till the vote goes up or down.
 *
 *   - To achieve Optimistic Update, React offers a hook "useOptimistic" that aims to help us with optimistic updating.
 *      - useOptimistic is a new React 19 hook that lets you optimistically update the UI while an async action
 *          is in progress â€” giving users instant feedback before the server responds.
 *
 *      - useOptimistic hook takes
 *          - 1st args as the input value that should eventually be updated optimistically or current state
 *
 *          - 2nd args as a optimistic function that will be invoked by React but at a point of time defined by us.
 *              - This will receive a parameter i.e., old state that's managed by the hook, automatically passed by React.
 *              - This function returns the optimistic state based on the current state & user input.
 *
 *      - useOptimistic hook returns an array of 2 elements:
 *          - Element 1: optimistic state i.e., optimistically managed value
 *              - This is a temporary UI state shown while the async action is pending
 *
 *          - Element 2: function that triggers the optimistic update
 *              - This will invoke the optimistic updating function (that we've passed as 2nd arg)
 *                  & also passes the arg to the optimistic func. For e.g., mode etc.
 *
 *              - This function can be called in any form action of our choice & the args are passed for optimistic update func.
